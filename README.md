# Data-Cleansing-Projects
This repository showcase my data cleaning projects where I turn messy datasets into clean, structured, easy to work with. Key tasks include removing duplicates, format data for consistency, and highlighting rows with monthly salaries over 5000 for quick insights. Iâ€™ve also added custom fonts to improve characteristics. Feel freely to check it out!
